# Who?
This app is developed by @MyPitit and @ivanmauricio from Founders and Coders.

# What?

*Tech needs:*
Invoices are currently created with a word template & entering data from an excel spreadsheet from which data is entered manually, it's a time-consuming process and UMHAN would like support for automation. Also they would benefit from an improved membership database (currently excel spreadsheet) which also links people to subgroup emails (done via jiscmail currently which is a lengthy process).
